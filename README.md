# SkillStream
Imagine a place online where any idea can become a career, this was SkillStream's goal.

I have been thinking of a system which gives people in a given area the connections and tools to create a job. I've based this project on the lack of jobs in the UK today where unemployment is at a record high. SkillsPages does something like this already but when I tried SkillsPages I found myself competing against people who have vastly more experience than myself in that given field. 

So I need to find a way to make it easier for everyone to get the opportunities they need... creating a fairer system which can get the inexperienced some experience and the more experienced would be limited, but that's ok, because there is other places they can go, such as LinkedIn or SkillsPages where they would more easily get the opportunities they wish.
